# C - Dynamic Libraries

First we need to understand the compilation stages in C programming Language.

1. **Preprocessing:**
In this stage, the preprocessor handles directives that start with the character "#", such as '# include' for header files, and '# define' for macros. Then this directives are expanded in the source code file.

2. **Compilation:**
The preprocessed code is then passed to a complier (e.g like **gcc**), which translates the code into assembly language or an intermediate representation. The output of this stage is usually a set of object file (i.e ".o" extension in UNIX system, or ".lib" in Windows).

3. **Assembly**:
The assembler (often 'as') takes the output of the compilation stage and translate it into machine code or an object file specific to the target architecture.

4. **Linking**:
The linker (such as 'ld') combines the object files generated by the complier along with any necessary system libraries to produce an executable binary.. It also resolves symbols (memory address) and addresses references between different parts of rhe program.
